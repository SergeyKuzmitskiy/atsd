## Overview

The [IBM Statistical Package for the Social Sciences 24](https://www.ibm.com/analytics/us/en/technology/spss/) (SPSS) is an advanced statistical analysis tool. This guide describes the process of loading data from ATSD into SPSS and demonstrates how to calculate the value of a derived series using Weighted Consumer Price Indices as an example.

SPSS provides several options for loading datasets from external data sources, such as Excel files or remote databases. To complete this exercise, sample data must be available in your instance of ATSD.

## SPSS Interface

**Menu Item** | **Description**
--------- | -----------
File | Import data from files, create and save datasets, connect to databases.
Data | Prepare datasets: select rows, aggregate, merge, split.
Transform | Transform data:  calculate new variables, convert dataset into time series or other data structure.
Analyze | Apply statistical functions to the dataset.

## Load Sample Data into ATSD

1. Log into the ATSD web interface
2. Open **Metrics > Data Entry**, select the **Commands** tab.
3. Copy the [`series` commands](./resources/commands.txt) into the form and click **Submit**.

![](./resources/metrics_entry.png)

The commands contain the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for each category of items in a consumer basket as well as a weight for each category in the CPI basket. The CPI is tracked from 2013 to 2017 and uses Year 2016 values as the baseline. Weight values are available for 2017. The underlying data is available in the following [Excel file](./resources/eng_e02.xls).

To calculate the weighted inflation index we need to multiply the CPI of each category by its weight divided by 1000 and sum the products.

## Import Data into SPSS

You can import ATSD data into SPSS by configuring an ODBC data source on a Windows machine and retrieving the records with an SQL query. Alternatively, you can run the queries in the [SQL Console](../../../sql/sql-console.md), export query results into CSV files, and manually load them into SPSS from the local file system.

### Import Data from Database

#### Prerequisites

* Configure an [ODBC-JDBC bridge](../../../integration/odbc) for ATSD:

  * Specify URL property `compatibility=odbc2`: `jdbc:atsd://atsd_hostname:ATSD_PORT;compatibility=odbc2`.

* Disable UNICODE mode:

  * Launch SPSS Statistics.
  * Do not open any existing data file.
  * Select the **Edit** menu.
  * Select the **Options** menu.
  * Select the **Language** tab.
  * In the section labeled **Character Encoding for Data and Syntax**, select **Locale writing system**

#### Option 1: Load Prices and Weights As Separate Datasets

* Open **File > Import Data > Database > New query...**.
* Select `inflation.cpi.categories.price` table, drag-and-drop `datetime`, `value` and `tags` into the list of selected columns.
* Click **Finish**.
* Save the imported data into the `prices.sav` file.

![](./images/select_prices.png)

* Open **File > Import Data > Database > New query...**.
* Select `inflation.cpi.categories.weight` table, drag-and-drop `datetime`, `value` and `tags` into the list of selected columns.
* Click **Finish**.
* Save the imported data into the `weights.sav` file.

![](./images/select_weights.png)

> Alternatively, you can execute [SPSS scripts](data-source.md) to load records from a data sources automatically.

* Proceed to the [Merge Datasets](#merge-datasets) section below.

#### Option 2: Loaded Merged Prices and Weights Dataset

* Open **File > Import Data > Database > New query...**.
* Select the `datetime` column from both the `inflation.cpi.categories.price` and `inflation.cpi.categories.weight` tables.
  ![](./images/merged_import/step1.png)
* Skip the next steps until a query editor is displayed.
* Enter a `FULL OUTER JOIN` query to fill gaps with interpolated records:

```sql
SELECT T0."value" AS price,  T1."datetime" AS datetime, T1."value" AS weight, T1."tags" AS tags
FROM "inflation.cpi.categories.price" T0
  OUTER JOIN "inflation.cpi.categories.weight" T1
WHERE T0.datetime BETWEEN '2013-01-01T00:00:00Z' AND '2017-01-01T00:00:00Z'
  WITH INTERPOLATE (1 YEAR, PREVIOUS, INNER, EXTEND)
```

![](./images/merged_import/step_3.png)

* Click **Finish**.
* Save the dataset as `prices_merged.sav`.

![](./images/merged_data1.png)

* Proceed to the [Analyze Dataset](#analyze-dataset) section below.

### Import from CSV Files

* Export data from ATSD into CSV files as described in [Exporting Data into CSV Files](#exporting-data-into-csv-files).
* Open **File > Import Data > CSV Data...**.
* Select CSV files and click **Open** to import the `prices.sav` and `weights.sav` files.

![](./images/import_dataset.png)

Data from the CSV files are now available as SPSS datasets `prices.sav` and `weights.sav`. Proceed to merge datasets.

## Merge Datasets

### Change Names of Columns

SPSS merges datasets using equal column names, similar `SELF JOIN` in SQL.

To prevent the `datetime` and `value` columns from being merged, their names must be changed in the `weights.sav` dataset using **Variable View** tab, otherwise the merged dataset produced by SPSS contains data only for 2017.

![](./images/variable_View.png)

Also rename `value` to `price` in the `prices.sav` dataset.

### Merge

Merge the two datasets by adding the `weight` column from the `weights.sav` dataset to the `prices.sav` dataset.

* Open **Data > Merge Files... > Add Variables...**
* Select `weights.sav` dataset.
* Check **Match cases on key variables**.
* Select `time` in the **New Active Dataset** pane, add to **Key Variables** Pane.

  ![](./images/merge_editor.png)
* Click **OK**.
* Remove `time` column using **Variable View**.

![](./images/time_clear.png)

Save the merged dataset as a new file `prices_merged.sav`.

![](./images/merged_data1.png)

## Analyze Dataset

To calculate the weighted CPI for each year, the CPI value for a given category must be multiplied by its weight and divided by 1000. The resulting products are summed to give the value of the weighted CPI.

### Calculate Weighted CPI per Category

Open the `prices_merged.sav` dataset and create the new column `categ_index`.

* Open **Transform > Compute Variable...**
* Place the columns from the left into the expression editor and specify a formula.
* Select the `price` and `weight` columns, divide `weight` by 1000 and multiply `price` by the adjusted `weight`.
* Assign a name to the new column.

![](./images/compute_variable.png)

The `categ_index` column is now available in the dataset.

![](./images/new_column.png)

### Calculate Annual CPI

SPSS provides two alternatives to aggregate data by period.

#### Aggregation using the Analyze Menu

* Open **Analyze > Reports > Report Summaries in Columns...**
* Move the `categ_index` column to the **Summary Variables** field and select the `SUM` aggregation function.
* Set the `datetime` column as the break variable, which is used to group the resulting data. You can format aggregation columns in the dialog window.

![](./images/analysis_reports_summary.png)

* Publish the report by selecting **File > Export As a Web Report** in the output window.
* The output contains the processing log in the results window.

    ![](./images/htm_report_spss.png)

* The report is also available in [HTML format](./resources/index_calculation.htm).

    ![](./images/htm_version_output.png)

#### Aggregation using the Data Menu

* Open **Data > Aggregate...**.
* Set `categ_index` as the summary variable and apply the `SUM` function.
* Set `datetime` as the break variable.
* Customize column formats and output options.
* Create a new dataset with the break and aggregated variables.

    ![](./images/aggregate_data.png)

* Create a new dataset with final columns `datetime` and `value`.

    ![](./images/cpi_annual.png)

## Export Derived Series into ATSD

Create a new metric in ATSD to store new series calculated in SPSS.

* Log in to ATSD, open **Metrics** > **Data entry** page and send a `metric` command.

```ls
metric m:cpi_price
```

![](./images/atsd_export_1.png)

* Open the previously created dataset in SPSS.

* Select **Transform > Compute Variable...**

  ![](./images/atsd_export_2.png)

  * Enter `entity` in the **Target Variable** field.
  * Enter `"bls.gov"` in the **Numeric Expression** field.

![](./images/atsd_export_3.png)

* Click **Type & Label...**.

![](./images/atsd_export_4.png)

* Set **Type** to **String** and click **Continue**.

![](./images/atsd_export_5.png)

* Click **OK** to apply the changes. Column `entity` now appears in the dataset.

![](./images/atsd_export_6.png)

* Open the **File** menu and select **Export > Database...**.

![](./images/atsd_export_7.png)

* Select `ATSD` data source, click **Next**.

![](./images/atsd_export_8.png)

* Select **Append new records to an existing table** and click **Next**

![](./images/atsd_export_9.png)

* Choose `cpi_price` table and click **Next**. The list of tables is based on the `tables=` driver property specified in the JDBC URL. If you do not see the table in the list, update ODBC data source as described [here](../../odbc/table-config.md) and re-open the export wizard.

![](./images/atsd_export_10.png)

* Associate table columns with metric fields.

![](./images/atsd_export11.png)

The result is as follows. Click **Next**

![](./images/atsd_export12.png)

* Select **ODBC > Row-wise binding**, select **Paste the syntax** and click **Finish**

![](./images/atsd_export_13.png)

* Paste the following script into the dialog window:

```sh
SAVE TRANSLATE /TYPE=ODBC
  /BULKLOADING BATCHSIZE=10000 METHOD=ODBC BINDING=ROW
  /CONNECT='DSN=ATSD;'
  /ENCRYPTED
  /MISSING=IGNORE
  /TABLE='cpi_price' /APPEND
  /KEEP=datetime, value, entity.
```

![](./images/atsd_export_14.png)

* Right-click the script window and select **Run All** to export the data into ATSD.

![](./images/atsd_export_15.png)

## Verify Insertion

To check that data is successfully exported to ATSD, open the ATSD web interface.

## Exporting Data into CSV Files

The built-in [SQL Console](../../../sql/sql-console.md) allows exporting query results into various data formats including Excel, CSV, and JSON, with optional metadata composed according to the [W3C Model for Tabular Data](../../../sql/api.md#metadata).

> If you do not have an ATSD installed, [weights.csv](./resources/weights.csv) and [prices.csv](./resources/prices.csv) are provided for your convenience. These files contain the output of the SQL queries listed below.

### Prices

Load CPI price data.

```sql
SELECT entity, datetime, value, tags.category
  FROM inflation.cpi.categories.price
ORDER BY tags.category, datetime
```

![](./images/sql_run.png)

Export query results into `prices.csv`.

![](./images/sql_export.png)

### Weights

Load weight records.

```sql
SELECT entity, datetime, value, tags.category
  FROM inflation.cpi.categories.weight
ORDER BY tags.category, datetime
```

Export query results into `weights.csv`.
